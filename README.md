# C1ick ⅋ c⊗LLec⊥

The repository contains
frontend and backend code
for an online interactive sequent prover for linear logic.

## Technical informations and roadmap
Some informations are available in the [wiki](https://github.com/etiennecallies/click-and-collect/wiki).

## Install
### Deploy on local dev environment
- Install dependencies
```
sudo apt-get install opam
opam init
sudo apt-get install libgdbm-dev libsqlite3-dev
opam depext ocsigen-start
opam install ocsigen-start
```
- Clone this repository
- Launch
```
cd click-and-collect
make test.byte
```
If the `opam depext ...` or `opam install ...` command fails, it might be 
because you are running a version of `ocaml` that is too old (for instance,
this is the case by default under Debian 10, which ships 4.05.0).
If so, you can try switching to a newer version:
```
opam switch create 4.12.0 # latest version at the time of writing
opam depext ocsigen-start
opam install ocsigen-start
```
(to get the list of available versions, use `opam switch list-available`).

### Deploy on server
Same as local dev, except that we need to proxy port 8080 by nginx (or Apache).
- Add this nginx config (install it with `sudo apt install nginx`)
```
server {
    root /home/{username}/click-and-collect;
    index index.html;
    server_name {hostname};

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:8080;
    }
}
```
- Allow https by adding a certificate `sudo certbot --nginx`

### Make LaTeX export work
If you don't have LaTeX environment installed on your machine (or your server), you can proceed as following to make LaTeX export work.
- Install TexLive (for LaTeX to PDF/PNG export) following guidelines like [these ones](https://doc.ubuntu-fr.org/utilisateurs/sssammm/installer_texlive).
- Install `poppler-utils` (for LaTeX to PNG export)
```
sudo apt-get install poppler-utils
```

### Make share proof work
You need to install [lzma](https://github.com/fccm/ocaml-lzma) package, which is sadly not available on opam.
```
git clone git@github.com:fccm/ocaml-lzma.git
opam pin add lzma ocaml-lzma/ -n
opam depext lzma
opam install lzma
```

## Contribute
### Modify Coq nanoyalla package
Whenever a file in `nanoyalla/` directory package is modified, nanoyalla version should be incremented that way:

1. Increment version in `nanoyalla/README.md`.
2. Increment version in `export_as_coq.ml`, in header printed in generated files.
3. Zip `nanoyalla/` directory: `rm -f static/download/nanoyalla.zip && zip -r static/download/nanoyalla.zip nanoyalla/`

### Modify parser
Do not modify `ll_parser.mli` or `ll_parser.ml` neither `ll_lexer.mll`, but just `ll_parser.mly` and `ll_lexer.mll` and then run
```
ocamllex ll_lexer.mll && ocamlyacc ll_parser.mly
```

## Test
### Test API
There are some API tests in `test/api_test.ml`, which uses test data in `api_test_data.json`. It calls API and checks its response.

First time:
```
opam install alcotest
```

First time and whenever you change test script (no need if you change only the json file):
```
ocamlfind ocamlc -thread -linkpkg -package alcotest -package lwt -package cohttp -package cohttp-lwt-unix -package threads -package yojson -package str -o test/api_test test/api_test.ml
```

To execute tests (you need to have `make test.byte` running):
```
test/api_test
```

### Test Coq
To check that Coq files returned by API actually compile, we have some examples of proof as json object in `test/proof_test_data`. Some additional Coq files can be checked to compile in `test/coq_test_data`.

To execute tests (you need to have `make test.byte` running):
```
test/coq_test.sh
```

### Test LaTeX
To check that LaTeX files returned by API actually compile, we have some examples of proof as json object in `test/proof_test_data`.

To execute tests (you need to have `make test.byte` running):
```
test/latex_test.sh
```
